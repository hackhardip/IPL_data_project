IPL ANALYTICS

In this Data visualization project, we tried to create visualization of most common graph one can imagine from Indian premium league. For this Project we used Flexdashboard at the top, which is generally use markdown to publish a group of related data visualization as a dashboard.

We also used shiny at the bottom level to drive visualization dramatically. For this project we had two csv data file. Deliveries and matches. Deliveries file contains a ball by ball information of each and every single match till 2019 which the latest year. Matches file had information related to match result.

We implemented 5 graphs which includes, • Top batsman • Top bowler • Extras • Batsman vs bowler • Strike rate

We also Created 1 simple data table from where one can access needed information, we used DT for that and we hosted whole application on shinyapps.io. one can access our application at
